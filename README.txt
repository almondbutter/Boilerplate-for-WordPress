Boilerplate is a barebones WordPress theme intended to speed up WordPress theme development. It includes all the features you should expect from WordPress themes along with a ton of useful optional features:

* SEO-friendly titles and descriptions
* "x days ago" dates
* Hideable admin menus and admin bar
* Custom login page logo
* Compressed and minified CSS
* ...

The theme provides an empty stylesheet with all the selectors ready to be filled in. All you have to do is enter your CSS, and you are good to go!

Although I made this for personal use, it is made to be used by anyone looking for a barebones theme.
