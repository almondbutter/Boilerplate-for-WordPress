Boilerplate is a barebones WordPress theme intended to speed up WordPress theme development. It includes all the features you should expect from WordPress themes without an ounce of bloat.

The page title and description are handled in the functions.php file. By default, they use the default option (wp_title + bloginfo), but enabling USE_DYNAMIC_TITLE and USE_DYNAMIC_DESCRIPTION allow the usage of SEO-friendly title suffixes and descriptions. When enabled, the title suffix is selected from an array of suffixes to make sure it doesn't exceed the length displayed in search results. The description is either taken from a custom field, the excerpt or the blog description, depending on availability.

The theme provides an empty stylesheet with all the selectors ready to be filled in. All you have to do is enter your CSS, and you are good to go!

Although I made this for personal use, it is made to be used by anyone looking for a barebones theme.
